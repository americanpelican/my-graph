# my-graph
A minimalistic Typescript-based graph server implementation which runs on top of high-performance databases, typically a document store, tuned to support visualizations of analyst-developed models.

# Audience
Programmers/analysts who are interested to develop graph models, capture data as basis for later analysis, typically some form of diagram visualization.

# Logical Structure
## Nodes
Used to represent real-life entities, with a few rules and features:
* Must have an unique identifier to facilitate reference, if not given will be assiged UUID,
* Must have exactly one type.
## Relationships
Take place between a pair of Nodes, Relationships or a Node and Relationship, with a few rules and features:
* Must have an unique identifier to facilitate reference, if not given will be assiged UUID,
* Must have exactly one type.
## Labels
Used to shape a domain or groups Nodes, Relationships into sets. Labels can be part of a hierarchy, including node type and associated constraints. Labels can be used to associate a set of Properties to Nodes and Relationships, with a few rules and features:
* Must have an unique identifier to facilitate reference, if not given will be assiged UUID,
## Properties
Name-value pairs are used to add qualities to nodes and relationships, with a few rules and features:
* Must have an unique identifier to facilitate reference, if not given will be assiged UUID,
* Must have a definition of data types such as number, string and boolean that it can hold.
## Constraints
Are used to ensure the nodes, relationships and properties adheres to the rules of the defined by types and labels.
## Indexes
Defined by schema, used to increase performance.
## Schema
Schema is optional, but could be used to define Types, Labels, Properties, Indexes and Constraints. Nodes, Relationships and Propertiesâ€‰ can be created without an up front schema. Indexes and constraints can be introduced when desired, in order to gain performance or modeling benefits.
# Technology
## Runtime
It should be run by a Javascript engine such as NodeJS or Deno, typically from a command line, but could be embedded into a browser-based application or thick client such as Electron.
## API
It will provide a Typescript API, still under definition.
## Database
Graph can be stored in memory, or rely a high-performance database server. Vision is that drivers would be available for different technologies and CouchDB will be used as reference implementation.
